                <p>You agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action.

                <h3>20. Waiver</h3>
                <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of AetherFlow.</p>
