            <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: April 25, 2024</p>

            <div class="policy-section">
                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>This Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions regarding refunds for subscription payments made for AetherFlow services. We strive to provide high-quality services, but we understand there may be circumstances where a refund is appropriate. This policy is designed to be fair to both our customers and our business.</p>
                <p>By purchasing a subscription to AetherFlow, you agree to this Refund Policy. Please read it carefully before making any purchases.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="policy-section">
                <h3>2. Subscription Fee Refund Eligibility</h3>
                
                <h4>2.1 Refund Window</h4>
                <p>We offer a 14-day refund window from the date of purchase for new subscriptions. If you are not satisfied with our service during this period, you may request a full refund of your subscription fee.</p>
                
                <h4>2.2 Renewal Payments</h4>
                <p>For automatic renewal payments, we offer a 7-day refund window from the date of the renewal charge. If you forgot to cancel your subscription before it renewed and have not used the service since the renewal date, you may request a refund within this period.</p>
                
                <h4>2.3 Upgrading or Downgrading</h4>
                <p>If you upgrade from one subscription plan to another, you may request a refund for the upgrade within 14 days of the upgrade date. The refund will be for the difference between the original plan and the upgraded plan.</p>
                <p>If you downgrade your subscription, the change will take effect at the end of your current billing period. No partial refunds will be issued for the remainder of the current billing period.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="policy-section">

                <h3>4. Free Trial Conversions</h3>
                <p>If you signed up for a free trial and did not cancel before the trial period ended, you may request a refund within 7 days of being charged for the first subscription period, provided you have not extensively used the service after the trial period ended.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="policy-section">
                <h3>5. How to Request a Refund</h3>
                <p>To request a refund, please email our customer support team at <a href="mailto:support@aetherflow.com">support@aetherflow.com</a> with the following information:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>The email address associated with your AetherFlow account</li>

            </div>

            <div class="policy-section">
                <h3>6. Refund Processing</h3>
                
                <h4>6.1 Approval Process</h4>
                <p>Once we receive your refund request, our team will review it to determine if it meets the eligibility criteria outlined in this policy. We may request additional information from you to help us make a determination.</p>
                
                <h4>6.2 Payment Method</h4>
                <p>Approved refunds will be issued to the original payment method used for the purchase. If the original payment method is no longer available or valid, we will work with you to find an alternative refund method.</p>
                
                <h4>6.3 Processing Time</h4>
                <p>Once approved, refunds typically take 5-10 business days to process and appear on your statement, depending on your payment provider. Please note that this timeframe is outside of our direct control and may vary.</p>
                
                <h4>6.4 Currency and Exchange Rates</h4>
                <p>Refunds will be issued in the same currency as the original payment. If exchange rates have fluctuated between the time of purchase and the time of refund, the amount refunded may differ slightly from the amount originally paid when converted to your local currency.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="policy-section">
                <h3>7. Account Status After Refund</h3>
                <p>Once a refund is issued, your subscription will be canceled and your account will revert to the Free Plan with limited features. Any premium features that were available with the paid subscription will no longer be accessible.</p>
                <p>If you received a refund for a renewal payment, your account will revert to the Free Plan as of the refund date.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="policy-section">
                <h3>8. Exceptions and Special Circumstances</h3>
                <p>We understand that special circumstances may arise that are not covered by this policy. If you believe you have a unique situation that warrants a refund outside of our standard policy, please contact our support team with details about your situation. We will review these requests on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                <p>In cases of service outages or technical issues that significantly impact your ability to use AetherFlow, we may offer partial refunds or service credits at our discretion, even if outside the standard refund window.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="policy-section">
                <h3>9. Chargebacks</h3>
                <p>If you dispute a charge through your credit card company or payment provider (a "chargeback") instead of contacting us for a refund, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account pending resolution of the chargeback. If the chargeback is found to be invalid, we may charge a processing fee to reinstate your account.</p>
                <p>We encourage you to contact our support team before initiating a chargeback so we can attempt to resolve any issues directly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="policy-section">
                <h3>10. Changes to This Policy</h3>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify this Refund Policy at any time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting to our website. It is your responsibility to review this policy periodically. Your continued use of our service after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
                <p>Significant changes to our refund terms will be communicated through email or notices on our website.</p>
